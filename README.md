# Blazed Systems

## Overview
Cloud service platform for the Blazed One Solution.

## Learn More
The Blazed Systems platform creates an interface (or bridge) between various partner platforms, in order to provide fully developed
solutions to business owners. In addition, we also provide support services, so their deployments will work as intended. For those tired of the countless hours spent hunting, interviewing, and training potential candidates for development position, the Blazed Systems solution has come to the rescue!

## For Developers
Do not worry! While all of our services are designed for user experience and ease-of-use, we have also put just as much effort into our API's and documentation, to help make the developer's experience positive, as well. And of course, all of our code is open source. Interested in learning more? Head on over to our [Documentation](https://www.blazed.systems/docs).
